項目簡介/Project intro:
Wordle is a captivating word-guessing game that has become popular for its simplicity and addictive gameplay. The goal is to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

The game board consists of six rows, each allowing the player to input a word. Upon entering a word, the player receives feedback indicating the presence of letters in the hidden word and their correct positions. If a letter is present but in the wrong position, it may be highlighted in a different color or marked with a distinct symbol. Players utilize these clues to deduce the correct letters and their placements.

The game challenges players to guess the word with the fewest attempts, under time constraints and limited attempts, adding excitement and suspense.
